This "sample_code" repository provides some of my coding examples for your review. 

Those examples are related to some projects I have developed with, yet drafted in a way to keep the HIPAA compliance and work related confidentiality & security policy.

Subfolder descriptions:

1.  "data_engineering_QA" - samples for conduct data extraction, data cleansing and data engineering process.
2.  "debugging" - a single file includes 4 examples in an effort of doing the debugging, including analysis of error impacts.
3.  "dynamic_prediction" - coding samples plus a report to implement an UI design using ad-hoc analysis to predict target outcomes.
4.  "ETL" - multiple samples to show the ETL process against various type of data sources.
5.  "feature_extraction" - samples to extract/computing features selected/evaluated and utilized in certain models.
6.  "model_training" - samples to show the training and re-training of certain models by using multiple popular classifiers.
7.  "plotting" - samples to draw plot by calling plotting package, which is a common way for model evaluation as well as data validation.
8.  "shell_script" - a few shell script samples associated with data operations running on servers.
9.  "SQL" - a single words document includes multiple SQL examples for QA, data tracing and reporting purpose.
10. "streams" - a few samples for streams application, coded in SPL (similar to C++), a language used in InfoSphere Streams.
